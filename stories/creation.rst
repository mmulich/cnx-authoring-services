Author wants to create a comprehensive document on a specific subject
=====================================================================

As an **Author**, I want to *create a comprehensive document on a
specific subject for his or her own needs*, so that he or she *can
capture these thoughts to possibly share with others at his or her
educational institute*.

**Much of this is based on assumptions, because I (or as far as I know
Connexions) has not made an indepth user testing sessions.**

As an **Author**, I want to *see a list of documents that I have
authored*, so that I can *easily reference and continue authoring at a
later time*.

As an **Author**, I want to *share my draft with colleagues
and peers*, so that I can *get feedback on the work prior to
publication*.

As a **Contributer**, I want to *allow my colleagues, students, and
friends to contribute to my work*, so that I *can be lazy and and take
credit for all the work they do*. ;)
