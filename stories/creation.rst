Author wants to create a comprehensive document on a specific subject
=====================================================================

As an *Author*,
I want to **create a comprehensive document on a
specific subject for his or her own needs**,
so that he or she *can
capture these thoughts to possibly share with others at his or her
educational institute*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an *Author*,
I want to **see a list of documents that I have
authored**,
so that I can *easily reference and continue authoring at a
later time*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an *Author* or *Contributor*,
I want to **see the state of published work**,
so that I can *know when my work has been published*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an *Author* or *Contributor*,
I want to **know the permalink to the published work**,
so that I can *share my finished work with others*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an *Author*,
I want to **share my draft with colleagues
and peers**,
so that I can *get feedback on the work prior to
publication*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an *Author*,
I want to **allow my colleagues, students, and
friends to contribute to my work**,
so that I can *be lazy and take
credit for all the work they do*. ;)
