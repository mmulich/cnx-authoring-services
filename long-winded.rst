Simple publishing
-----------------

A single author, named Ann, would like to create a short book about
the Loch Ness Monster. She knows the basic outline of the book. That
outline is as follows:

- Folklore
- Beliefs
- Facts

It's a very simple book that is meant to be used in as a companion
study book for a single lesson in a course on Scottish Folklore.

Based on the outline, she has decided to break the book into three
chapters. These chapters will have text, pictures and links to various
YouTube videos of Nessy.

She would like the links to the YouTube videos to display inline on
the page when the content is viewed on the web; and to be a outline
box containing a caption and link to the content when the content is
viewed in a static format (e.g. PDF or Dead tree).

.. note:: The following paragraph strays from the simple case.

She plans to continuously publish the content as she does more
research on the subject. And she may want to publish the various parts
of the content at different times. She understands that once a
publication is made, it cannot be changed. But she would like her
educational institute to provide (anonymous) peers with access to
the latest unpublished content.

Deriving works
--------------

A reader of Scottish Folklore: The Loch Ness Monster, named Frank, has
noticed some missing information in the work. Frank is a professor
that has some research on Nessy folklore. He wants to add his research
findings to this work so that he can better inform his class. Frank
does not know Ann, the original author of this work.

Frank finds the published work online and decides to derive a copy,
because the license allows him to do so. Frank's institution has
recently added a system that will allow him to make modifications to
this published work. 

Frank publishes the work on his educational institute's publication
system. This allows his students and other members of the institute to
view this fine piece of work.

Contributing and Merging the work
---------------------------------

Frank meets Ann at a Highlands History conference. Frank shows Ann the
modifications he has made to her original work. Ann is excited and
would like to merge Frank's modifications. Additionally she would like
to make Frank a co-author of the book.
However, neither of them have time to merge this
information at this time. And a lot of changes have been made by both
Ann and Frank, so much so that merging these pieces of work will be a
:abbr:`PITA (pain in the ass)` and require them to discuss the merger
at length.

Later, when Ann get's back to her desk, she discovers that her
educational institute just added a merge derived work button to the
system. Ann follows the instructions to merge Frank's work into her
own. The content is a mess of disconnected information but everything
has been merged and Ann is happy.

Also, the system has asked Ann if she would like to give Frank
author privileges. Ann gives Frank the author role and the system
notifies him by email.



Contributing to a piece of work
-------------------------------

Ann has an exceptionally talented student aid for the next two
years. She would like to allow the student, named Ali, to contribute
to the Nessy book. Ali has been given rights to contribute contribute
to the 'beliefs' chapter, but he can only view the other modules. Ann
doesn't trust Ali to contribute to the 'folklore' or 'facts' chapters,
because Ali has a tendency to stretch the truth.

Ann gives Ali contributor rights to the 'beliefs' chapter and sends
him on his way. Ann occationally checks his process by viewing the
changes that he has made. Ann is pleasantly surprised how simple it is
to view the modifications that Ali made.
